1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    It's a request handler function with access to the application's request-response cycle and holds the request object, the response object, and the middleware function.
    Middleware can also send the response to the server before the request.

2. What does CRUD stand for?
    CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    3.1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
        Using "dotenv" package then I add "require('dotenv')" and retrieve the values using "process.env.[var name]"

    3.2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
        It must be added to ".gitignore" file so it doesn't get pushed to git repository
